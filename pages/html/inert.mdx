# inert

The `HTMLElement` property **`inert`** is a boolean value that, when present, makes the browser "ignore" user input events for the element, including focus events and events from assistive technologies.

The `inert` attribute was originally specified in the context of the dialog element [about 10 years ago](https://github.com/whatwg/html/commit/2fb24fcf), where the main use-case was making the content behind a modal dialog non-interactive. It was later removed due to a lack of adoption.

## Syntax

```
isInert = HTMLElement.inert;

HTMLElement.inert = true | false;
```

A node (in particular elements and text nodes) can be **inert**. When a node is [inert](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#inert):

- Hit-testing must act as if the ['pointer-events'](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-4/#pointer-events-control) CSS property were set to 'none'.
- Text selection functionality must act as if the ['user-select'](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-4/#content-selection) CSS property were set to 'none'.
- If it is [editable](https://w3c.github.io/editing/docs/execCommand/#editable), the node behaves as if it were non-editable.
- The user agent may ignore the node for the purposes of [find-in-page](find-in-page).

## Example

```html
<body>
  <div class="modal">
    <h2>Modal Title</h2>
    <p>...</p>
    <button>Save</button>
    <button>Discard</button>
  </div>
  <main inert>
    <!-- cannot be keyboard focused or clicked -->
  </main>
</body>
```

## Visually indicate inert elements

By default, there is no visual indication of a subtree being inert. It is recommended that you clearly mark what parts of the DOM are active and which are inert.

```css
[inert],
[inert] * {
  opacity: 0.5;
  pointer-events: none;
  cursor: default;
  user-select: none;
}
```

## Pre-existing Solutions

The most basic way to disable all interactions is the `disabled` HTML attribute, it prevents focus, clicks, edition or selection. However, **it only works on form controls**, and does not necessarily hide the control from assistive technologies.

### To prevent focus

`tabindex="-1"` is a popular option, but it isn’t ideal because **setting the attribute on a container element will not prevent its children from being focused, and it also does not prevent click-focus with a mouse**. If you want to prevent keyboard focus on a whole section, every single focusable element in the section needs the attribute set.

### To prevent clicks

the `pointer-events: none` CSS property may be an option although, unless you’ve put `tabindex="-1"` on the element as well, **tabbing to the element and interacting with it is still possible**.

### To prevent selection

the `user-select: none` CSS property is the most common option.

### To prevent editing

If you’re using `contenteditable`, you would need to manually remove the `contenteditable` attribute. If it’s a form control, you need to manually set the `disabled` attribute.
