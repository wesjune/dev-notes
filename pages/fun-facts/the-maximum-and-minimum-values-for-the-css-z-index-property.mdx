# The maximum and minimum values for the CSS z-index property

The `z-index` property is specified as either the keyword `auto` or an `<integer>`.

There are no restrictions on the z-index value in the CSS standard. However, in most browsers, it is limited to a signed 32-bit value ranging from **-2147483648** to **+2147483647**.
