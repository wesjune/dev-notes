# Formatting contexts

Everything on a page is part of a **formatting context**, or an area which has been defined to lay out content in a particular way. A **block formatting context** (BFC) will lay child elements out according to block layout rules, a **flex formatting context** will lay its children out as flex items, etc. Each formatting context has specific rules about how layout behaves when in that context.

## Block formatting contexts

A **block formatting context** (BFC) is a part of a visual CSS rendering of a web page. It's the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which floats interact with other elements.

## Inline formatting contexts

Inline formatting contexts exist inside other formatting contexts and can be thought of as the context of a paragraph. The paragraph creates an inline formatting context inside which such things as `<strong>`, `<a>`, or `<span>` elements are used on text.
