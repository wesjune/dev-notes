# min(), max(), and clamp()

- `min(<value-list>)`: selects the smallest (most negative) value from a list of comma-separated expressions
- `max(<value-list>)`: selects the largest (most positive) value from a list of comma-separated expressions
- `clamp(<min>, <ideal>, <max>)`: clamps a value between an upper and lower bound, based on a set ideal value

```css
.min {
  width: min(50%, 400px);
}

.max {
  width: max(50%, 400px);
}

p {
  width: clamp(45ch, 50%, 75ch);
}

p {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 3rem);
}
```

For example, in the case of: `min(1rem, 50%, 10vw)`, the browser calculates which of these relative units is the smallest, and uses that value as the actual value.

The `max()` function selects the largest value from a list of comma-separated expressions.

> When using a calculation inside of a `min()`, `max()`, or `clamp()` function, you can remove the call to `calc()`. For example, writing `font-size: max(calc(0.5vw - 1em), 2rem)` would be the same as `font-size: max(0.5vw - 1em, 2rem)`.

The CSS math functions, `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` are very powerful, well supported, and could be just what you're looking for to help you build responsive UIs.
