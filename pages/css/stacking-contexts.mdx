# Stacking contexts

The **stacking context** is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this space in priority order based on element attributes.

A stacking context is formed, anywhere in the document, by any element in the following scenarios:

- Root element of the document (`<html>`).
- Element with a `position` value `absolute` or `relative` and `z-index` value other than `auto`.
- Element with a `position` value `fixed` or `sticky` (sticky for all mobile browsers, but not older desktop).
- Element that is a child of a `flex` container, with `z-index` value other than `auto`.
- Element that is a child of a `grid` container, with `z-index` value other than `auto`.
- Element with an `opacity` value less than `1` (See [the specification for opacity](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#transparency)).
- Element with a `mix-blend-mode` value other than `normal`.
- Element with any of the following properties with value other than `none`:
  - `transform`
  - `filter`
  - `backdrop-filter`
  - `perspective`
  - `clip-path`
  - `mask` / `mask-image` / `mask-border`
- Element with an `isolation` value `isolate`.
- Element with a `will-change` value specifying any property that would create a stacking context on non-initial value (see [this post](https://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/)).
- Element with a `contain` value of `layout`, or `paint`, or a composite value that includes either of them (i.e. `contain: strict`, `contain: content`).

Within a stacking context, child elements are stacked according to the same rules previously explained. Importantly, the `z-index` values of its child stacking contexts only have meaning in this parent. Stacking contexts are treated atomically as a single unit in the parent stacking context.

In summary:

- Stacking contexts can be contained in other stacking contexts, and together create a hierarchy of stacking contexts.
- Each stacking context is completely independent of its siblings: only descendant elements are considered when stacking is processed.
- Each stacking context is self-contained: after the element's contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context.
