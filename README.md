# Wes Juneâ€™s Dev Notes

Most of the articles on this website are my personal notes compiled from various sources. These notes are mainly for my personal learning so that I can quickly review them when needed. I will add reference links to each article.

This project is built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site).

## Local Development
